                A coffee shop is a cozy and casual establishment where people
                can enjoy a variety of coffee-based beverages, light snacks, and
                sometimes even pastries or desserts. These establishments are
                typically designed to create a warm and inviting atmosphere,
                often featuring comfortable seating arrangements, soothing
                music, and a welcoming ambiance.

                Customers visit coffee shops not only for their caffeine fix but
                also as social hubs and places to relax, work, or have casual
                meetings. The menu at a coffee shop typically includes a range
                of coffee options such as espresso, cappuccino, latte, and
                brewed coffee. Many coffee shops also offer a selection of teas,
                hot chocolates, and cold beverages like iced coffee or iced tea.
                In addition to drinks, coffee shops often provide a limited menu
                of sandwiches, salads, and baked goods.
